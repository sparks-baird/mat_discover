Welcome to Chemically Novel Materials Discovery!
================================================

This is the documentation for `mat_discover <https://github.com/sparks-baird/mat_discover>`_. Descending from Stochastic Clustering Variance Regression (DiSCoVeR) is a
composition-based materials
discovery algorithm. DiSCoVeR emphasizes exploring high-performance candidates in new chemical
spaces as originally proposed by Baird, Diep, and Sparks (`10.33774/chemrxiv-2021-5l2f8-v3 <https://dx.doi.org/10.33774/chemrxiv-2021-5l2f8-v3>`_). The
library :code:`mat_discover` provides a GPU-accelerated (and CPU-compatible) Python
implementation and tools for analyzing the outputs. :code:`mat_discover` will "suggest your next experiment" using a custom training dataset of chemical formula and target
properties and a custom validation set of potential candidates. All in just a few lines of code! `Get started learning about DiSCoVeR <https://mat-discover.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html>`_.
